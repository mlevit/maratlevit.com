summary: 'Seven tools to make your articles and presentations look professional and consistent.'
---

Great presentations flow, tell a story, and in general, look appealing. Similarly, well-written articles are accompanied by nicely designed graphics, imagery, and high-quality photos.

Your writing style is your own, and that I canâ€™t and wonâ€™t be able to help you with. However, I can try to improve the look and feel of your articles and presentations with a little help from a few popular toolsets.

Letâ€™s begin.

## Stock Photos

Iâ€™ve seen and created my fair share of professional presentations, and thereâ€™s always one aspect thatâ€™s common to them allâ€¦ one-liner impact statements. Whether itâ€™s to drive a point home, scare the crap out of you, or quote a loosely related article or study, more often than not, these one-liners appear alongside a beautiful stock photo that by some stretch of the imagination is associated with the one-liner itself.

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is my first choice for beautiful free photos.

## Icons

Icons! How I love and loathe you. Theyâ€™re a must in any presentation, website, article; you name it. Finding the right one isnâ€™t too hard, finding the right ten is a task in and of itself. You need to ensure they have a matching style and similar stroke (line thickness) otherwise itâ€™ll look messy.

[Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) is an exceptionally fantastic resource for icons. Their collection is near infinite, and they offer free icons (with attribution) or no attribution necessary for a small yearly fee. My only gripe is the inability to filter or change icon stroke.

## Illustrations

You want to spruce up that one slide with a great looking yet relevant illustration but youâ€™re all icon-ed outâ€¦ weâ€™ve all been there. If only there were a website that could help. Holy cow! There is. I present you [unDraw](https://undraw.co/). Created by the amazing [Katerina Limpitsouni](https://twitter.com/ninaLimpi), unDraw provides beautiful, diverse, and completely royalty-free illustrations that are in sync with current events and technologies.

## Fonts

For the love of all that is holy, use a beautiful font. So many companies are investing time and money into typography, it shouldnâ€™t be that hard to find a great looking font that works with your content.

I along with many others, prefer to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). They offer (at the time of writing) 999 free to use fonts that can be embedded within web pages, downloaded to your Mac or Windows PC, or used within G Suite directly.

## Screenshots

Letâ€™s talk screenshots. Whether theyâ€™re of a product, a website, or a solution we builtâ€¦ we always include them in our blogs and presentations. Why not spruce them up a little bit with [Screely](https://www.screely.com/).

With Screely, you can customise the background, the window type, style and padding.

Thanks to [@woraperth](https://medium.com/@woraperth) for sharing Screely with me.

## Code Blocks

Whether youâ€™re sharing your code snippets within a Medium article, on Twitter, or in a presentation to a client, generally speaking, itâ€™ll look dull and boring.

[Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) is here to the rescue. With plenty of customisable features including fonts, background colours, window styles, and the ability to export as an image, iFrame, Medium embed or URL, you canâ€™t go wrong.

    const pluckDeep = key => obj => key.split('.').reduce((accum, key) => accum[key], obj)

    const compose = (...fns) => res => fns.reduce((accum, next) => next(accum), res)

    const unfold = (f, seed) => {
      const go = (f, seed, acc) => {
        const res = f(seed)
        return res ? go(f, res[1], acc.concat([res[0]])) : acc
      }
      return go(f, seed, [])
    }

## Bonus Round: Avatars

Weâ€™ve all been there. We need a slide to showcase the team. Some team members have professional headshots (so last year!) while others have photos with mystery shoulders, babies, or worseâ€¦ lycra. Donâ€™t be that team, use [Big Heads](https://bigheads.io/), a dynamically generated avatar that you can customise to your liking.
