Orchestration is hard. Orchestrating the mess that are data platforms is even more challenging. You have countless source systems, all with their delivery schedules, numerous load, transformation, and extraction jobs, each with their dependencies and SLAs. So, as we've done for the many years that have passed, we orchestrate all these based on either a batch, a time of day/day of the week, or based on the data pipelines (jobs) themselves.

What we've essentially created is a false economy. Will the orchestration work? Sure. Will the orchestration have limitations and be a headache to maintain? Absolutely.

## Let's define the problem

To understand precisely why these methods are inadequate, let's break them down and point out their deficiencies.
