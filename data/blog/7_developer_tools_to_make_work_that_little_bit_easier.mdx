I've always been interested in tools that make my work-life easier, faster or just plain better. Over the years, I've compiled a list of tools I've found most helpful that I turn to again and again.

## Password Manager: [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)

As a consultant that moves around between clients usually every 6-12 months, I'm always bombarded with passwords for different databases, environments, applications, and systems. Remembering the passwords and rotating them every 3 months can be a challenge.

This is where KeePass comes in. It's a locally hosted password manager that encrypts all your username, passwords, URLs, and additional parameters in a single file (if using the portable version). If using the portable edition, you can easily share the file with others on your team simply by sending the file to them. This also works really well for system/support teams where they need to manage and keep on top of all the administrator passwords for all the servers, databases, applications etc.

## SQL Playground: [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/)

Sometimes you need a quick database playground to play around with making a few tables, inserting some data, and running a few queries. Instead of standing up a database (either via a cloud platform, or a locally hosted installation) as well as installing a local [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for the sake of connecting — you can use DB Fiddle. An online MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite database playground.

Your environment can even be saved and shared with others (e.g. [below example link](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/kyaXR8R7ysPvyYnUSuWnMB/0)) for collaboration and even includes the ability to fork the shares.

## SQL Formatter: [Instant SQL Formatter](http://www.dpriver.com/pp/sqlformat.htm)

One of my pet peeves is badly formatted code, be it Java, Python or SQL. Instant SQL Formatter by Gudu Software is the best SQL formatting tool I've used. I found it to be the most consistent and reliable with formatting a myriad number of different SQL statements.

There are plenty of options to play around with to make the SQL format just the way you like it, and it even handles multiple database types (MySQL, Oracle, DB2, etc.).

## Code Playground: [REPL](https://repl.it/)

REPL is an amazing tool. If you need a code playground for Java, Python, Node.JS, HTML and more([the list goes on](https://repl.it/languages)), then REPL is music to your ears.

The functionality you get from a free online tool is mind-blowing. It allows you to import existing code, install from a list of thousands of libraries or packages, create an entire project online, save and share the project with others for collaboration and even embed the project in websites such as this one:

There are countless uses for REPL, and most of the time, I've used it to develop code quickly and easily without needing to install the language and packages on my machine first. I can't praise this tool enough.

## Regular Expression Helper: [Regex 101](https://regex101.com/)

Regular expressions for all intents and purposes can be the most amazing and yet frustrating queries you will ever write. The sheer power of regular expressions is sometimes breathtaking but writing and testing them can be a nightmare.

Introducing regular expressions 101. By far, the best tool for developing and testing regular expression queries. Not only does the tool provide a fantastic interface for writing your regex queries, but it also breaks down your query and explains each part of it for you (similar to a query plan when running SQL queries). There is also a great little reference guide for often used regex functions.

And like with REPL and DB Fiddle, you can save and share your regex query (e.g. [below example link](https://regex101.com/r/nq07h1/4)) along with all the test strings and unit tests you've built for it.

Once you've built your query, you can develop unit tests that can be executed against your query in an isolated fashion. This allows you to validate your query against a myriad of scenarios. The great thing about this feature is as your query changes; you can continue to run the unit tests against it to ensure you haven't broken any of them.

[Somesh Bahuguna](undefined) told me about another useful regular expression tool [Regexper](https://regexper.com/) which displays your regular expression logic visually. Looks useful in breaking down complex expressions.

## Difference Checker: [DiffChecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/)

A straightforward but useful tool. Compare two pieces of text together to highlight the differences. There's really nothing more to it than that.

## Text Sharing: [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/)

This is probably one of the most versatile products in this list. The tool allows you to make any piece of text shareable and anonymous. You can add code related formatting to your “share” (i.e. Java, Python, HTML etc.) or leave it as plain text.

Shares can have an expiry date as well as an exposure setting (public, unlisted or private). Copy, paste, save and share. It's that simple.

## What are your favourite tools?

I'd love to hear which tools you've found to be the most useful, be it online or application. If it comes in handy and saves you a bunch of time, I'd love to know about it.
