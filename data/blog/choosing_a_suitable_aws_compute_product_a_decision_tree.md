[Update: Version 2 is out now. Grab it while it’s hot!](https://servian.dev/finding-the-right-aws-compute-service-for-your-workload-9fe9fe0ebbb6)

With over 175 products on offer by AWS, selecting the most appropriate one for your workload can at times be an overwhelming exercise.

I’ve decided to tackle this task by creating a decision tree of sorts focusing specifically on compute products.

Compute workloads are broken down into three areas, **analytical**, **application**, and **machine learning**. Selecting a workload type will take you on a Q&A journey until you finally reach your recommended product.

Give it a try and let me know if I’ve missed a product that you believe should be included or if some of the wording should be tweaked.

Below I’ve made available both the PNG and PDF versions of the decision tree for download.
